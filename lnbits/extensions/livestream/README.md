# DJ Livestream

An extension to help DJs to conduct music livestreams.

It produces a single static QR code that can be shown on screen. Once someone scans that QR code with an lnurl-pay capable wallet they will see the name of the track being played at that time and the name of the producer.

They will then be given the opportunity to send a tip and a message related to that specific track and if they pay an amount over a specific threshold they will be given a link to download it (optional).

The revenue will be sent to a wallet created specifically for that producer, with optional revenue splitting between the DJ and the producer.
